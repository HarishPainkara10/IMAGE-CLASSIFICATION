# Image-Classification
This project focuses on classifying images into predefined categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Workflow:
Data Collection: Gather and label a dataset of images.
Data Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and augment images to prepare them for training.
Model Selection: Use a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) or design a custom architecture.
Training: Train the model on the dataset, using techniques to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy and other metrics on validation and test sets.
Deployment: Use the trained model to classify new images.
Requirements:
Python
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
NumPy, OpenCV, and other libraries as needed for data handling and preprocessing
Usage:
Prepare the dataset and organize it into training and test folders.
Run the training script: python train.py
Evaluate the model: python evaluate.py
Use the model for predictions: python predict.py <image_path>
